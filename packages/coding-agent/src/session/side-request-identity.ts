/**
 * Provider-facing identity for independent background/side model requests,
 * isolated from the foreground provider session so they cannot advance it and
 * reject a waiting foreground turn (upstream issues #10619, #10865; adapted
 * from upstream PR #10869 for the EF1-R1 contract).
 *
 * The Anthropic Messages backend orders a conversation by
 * `metadata.user_id.session_id` (a JSON envelope built by
 * {@link buildSessionMetadata}). A background request that surfaces the
 * foreground session id while a foreground request is in flight contends on
 * the same provider session and sticky credential: a classifier rotation can
 * clear or rotate the foreground's pinned account mid-turn.
 *
 * Automatic title requests already isolate their identity (upstream #10621,
 * merged here); this module generalizes that pattern for the auto-thinking
 * classifier. Each call to {@link sideRequestIdentity} mints a fresh id, so
 * two side requests of the same kind that run concurrently never advance one
 * another. Derive the identity when a logical request starts — passing the
 * *current* foreground session id — so a long-lived component does not keep
 * authenticating a later session against an earlier one's account after
 * `newSession`/`switchSession`.
